# bcnc-reactjs

Is a ReactJS test, done with typescript and other ReactJS libraries.

It's responsive, works cross-browser and has two components: the left component has some Q & A about programming, the right component shows data repeatedly (every two minutes) from an API (and order these datas by title property).

## Get started

To run project locally, once you have ReactJS working on your machine (NodeJS, Node Package Manager...) and you have installed the project dependencies (npm install) you can run npm start from your terminal.

```bash
npm start
```
