# dev-questions-reactjs

Is a ReactJS test, done with typescript and other ReactJS libraries.

It's responsive, works cross-browser and has two components: the left component has some Q & A about programming, the right component shows data repeatedly (every two minutes) taken from an API (and order these datas by title property).
